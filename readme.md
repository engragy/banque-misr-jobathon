a simple application written with [python, django, django-framework] that has a simple API with only one end-point (/live).
this endpoint will respond with "Well Done" or "Maintenance" if the system can interact with its Database.

i have created docker files for the system to be containerized (MicroServices).

i have not used Terraform untill now in my work, so i do not have much information about it, uet i guess it is simple to get used to it as i already have some knowledge about CloudFormation of AWS.

you could try the app with simple linux knowledge, whicj is what i do without the automation.
